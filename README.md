# schedulingSignals_OperatingSystem

This project aims to explore inter-process communication through signaling in the C programming language. Inter-process communication (IPC) in the C, combined with Bash scripting, leverages the Round Robin (RR) and Lucky 7 (L7) algorithms to optimize communication channels between processes. These advanced algorithms enhance efficiency, reliability, and data synchronization, facilitating seamless coordination and collaboration.
