# schedulingSignals_OperatingSystem

This project aims to explore inter-process communication through signaling in the C programming language, combined with Bash scripting, leveraging the Round Robin (RR) and Lucky 7 (L7) algorithms to optimize communication channels between processes. These advanced algorithms enhance efficiency, reliability, and data synchronization, facilitating seamless coordination and collaboration.
